### Short Description
This is just a simple calculator program that I made using Dart. <br> There's nothing much
in here really, but if you wanna check it out go ahead!

## Features

This calculator has plenty of features such as the classics Addition, Subtraction, Multipication and Division!<br>
Since its a simple calculator you can't really expect much features. If you really want an actual working calculator,<br>
Windows has a built in calculator that you can use. 


## Usage

Run the calculator via Terminal as follows:
```powershell
dart run lib/system.dart
```


## Additional information

This is a school project on making a simple system using the stuff that we have learned in class. Feel free to use it!
